![Anastasiia Vlasenko, PhD](/anastasiia-vlasenko.jpg)

I am a Postdoctoral Research Scholar in the Harriman Institute at Columbia University, a Research Associate at Harvard University, and a Visiting Professor at Kyiv School of Economics. I am also a recent HURI Research Fellow at Harvard’s Ukrainian Research Institute and a recent Postdoctoral Fellow at the NYU Jordan Center for the Advanced Study of Russia. My primary research focus is electoral politics and democratization with specialization in politics of Ukraine and Russia. My monograph project, “Legislators in Networks: Corruption, Clientelism, and Law Making" investigates how legislative networks formed through parliamentary aids can affect rent-seeking behavior in the Ukrainian parliament. I am particularly interested in transitional period reforms, propaganda, legislative politics, and forecasting. My research has been published in the Journal of Politics and PS: Political Science & Politics. 

I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Political Science at Florida State University in 2022, M.A. in Political Science from Florida State University in 2018, M.A. in International Relations from New York University in 2016, and M.Sc. in European Affairs from Lund University in 2013, and B.A. in Political Science from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy in 2011. In 2020-2021, I worked at Hertie School in Berlin as a visiting researcher. In 2014-2016, I was a Fulbright scholar at New York University. At Florida State University, New York University, and Kyiv School of Economics, and Columbia University I have been teaching courses on comparative politics, public policy, quantitative methods, Ukrainian politics, and post-Soviet studies. Currently, I am also a member of REDEMOS research consortium.
