![Anastasiia Vlasenko, PhD Candidate in Political Science, FSU](/anastasiia-vlasenko.jpg)

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at Florida State University. I hold MA in Political Science (Florida State University, 2018), MA in International Relations (New York University, 2016), and MSc in European Affairs (Lund University, 2013). In 2014-2016, I was a Fulbright scholar at New York University. In 2020-2021, I worked at Hertie School in Berlin as a visiting researcher.

I study electoral politics and democratization with specialization in politics of Ukraine and Russia. I am particularly interested in transitional period reforms, propaganda, legislative politics, and forecasting. At FSU, I teach courses on comparative politics and post-Soviet studies.
