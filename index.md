![Anastasiia Vlasenko, PhD Candidate in Political Science, FSU](/anastasiia-vlasenko.jpg)

I am a research fellow at the Harvard’s Ukrainian Research Institute, a visiting professor at Kyiv School of Economics, and a postdoctoral fellow at the NYU Jordan Center for the Advanced Study of Russia. My primary research focus is electoral politics and democratization with specialization in politics of Ukraine and Russia. My monograph project, ‘The Electoral Effects of Decentralization: Evidence from Ukraine’ investigates how decentralization reform affects electoral mobilization and diversity in a weakly institutionalized democracy. I am particularly interested in transitional period reforms, propaganda, legislative politics, and forecasting. My research has been published in the Journal of Politics and PS: Political Science & Politics.  

I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Political Science at Florida State University in 2022, M.A. in Political Science from Florida State University in 2018, M.A. in International Relations from New York University in 2016, and M.Sc. in European Affairs from Lund University in 2013, and B.A. in Political Science from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy in 2011. In 2020-2021, I worked at Hertie School in Berlin as a visiting researcher. In 2014-2016, I was a Fulbright scholar at New York University. At Florida State University, New York University, and Kyiv School of Economics, she has been teaching courses on comparative politics, public policy, quantitative methods, and post-Soviet studies.
